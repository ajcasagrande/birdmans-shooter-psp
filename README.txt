Programmer: theb1rdm4n
Images: I did not create the original images, i found them on the internet, but i photoshoped them to create the images for the game, and to change the color of the enemies.

This is my first attempt to program a game in C for the PSP. It is loosly based off of the game galaga.

***Known Bug*** 
Enemies sometimes get stuck to each other and don't move. (I am currently working on this problem for a future release.)
