	 Game Description
*************************************
	This is my first attempt to program a game in C for the PSP. It is loosely based off of the game galaga. The game pits you against endless waves of enemies that get harder as the game goes on. Every 8 levels there is a bonus level and the enemies get harder, but the enemy count resets back to level one and continues to grow every level.  If you perfect a bonus level you get an extra life and bonus points.  Scores grow exponentially as the current level and difficulty increase.  Scores are also slightly based off of your accuracy, so the more accurate you are, the higher your score will be.

	    Installing
*************************************
First make sure the game is unzipped, then plug the psp into the computer and browse to its location.  Create a folder on the psp called "PSP". Then inside that create a folder called "GAME150". Then copy the unzipped folder into the "GAME150" folder.  

So the full windows path should look something like:  
 
 P:\PSP\GAME150\BirdmansShooter1.3\       
	(where P: is the drive letter of the psp memory stick)
 
Inside the "Birdmans Shooter" folder should be files called "EBOOT.PBP", "data v13.dat", "data2 v13.dat", and another folder called "images".

Note: This game (and other hombrew games) require a custom firmware. If you don't know what that is, google it.

Any questions or suggestions for improvements for future releases?

This game was developed and tested using a 3.90m33-3 Phat PSP.

Note: I did not create the original images. I found some them on the internet, but all of the font work and image editing was done by me.

Most of the new backgrounds in version 1.3 came from <http://www.space.com/php/multimedia/downloads/wallpapers/>.
Many thanks and all credit for the images go to them, i merely cropped them to fit and look nice on the PSP's screen.
